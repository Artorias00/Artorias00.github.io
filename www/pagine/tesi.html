    <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
    <p>  Acquisitions were conducted on 15 subjects all with the same protocol,
       in a sitting position and with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Quest" target="_blank">Oculus Quest</a> viewer,

       <a href="https://www.movisens.com/en/products/ecg-sensor/"target="_blank">ECG</a> taken as gold standard. <br><br>
       the protocol consists of 4 videos approved
         by a psychologist capable of changing the emotional state of the subject
       and a respiratory test </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The linear correlation graphs about the comparisons between ECG heart
rate and BCG in the different phases show extremely low correlation values when using
the total BCG signal. However, these values increase when the BCG signal considered is
composed of the acceptable windows only.</p>

  <h2 style="color: black">Conclusions</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">This work proposed a method for estimating heart rate through the BCG signal of the head
obtained through the use of the VR viewer only. A qualitative analysis was implemented to
define the acceptability of particular BCG signal windows in order to be able to consider
those only in subsequent studies. <br><br> The results found differ if we consider the signals in their
entirety or the signals cleared of noises, suggesting the usefulness of defining automatic
recognition algorithms in the future.
Furthermore, the study proposed an audio-video protocol to induce possible heart rate
variations, which can be recorded using a VR viewer. <br><br> The results obtained by studying
only the analysable windows of ECG and BCG revealed significant differences between
the Baseline and the phases of Mental Stress and Fear, laying the groundwork for
subsequent studies.</p>
